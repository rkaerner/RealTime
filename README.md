RealTime for FS15 by Marhu (http://marhu.net) improved by Bauer Hannsen

Realtime is a mod for Farming Simulator 15. Original maintainer is Marhu (http://marhu.net)
After asking him for permission I improved the mod by adding the actual day in game and also 
adding the actual weekday in short form. To fulfill a special wish of an user every sunday is colored red.

To use it, just download the zip archive and put it into your mods directory.
